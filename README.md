Lab Answers:
1. The LEDs go from 0 to 59 seconds despite us using 6 bits which means we reach up until 64 characters. This is because the code given only allows for the bits to only go to 60 characters as the code is meant to imitate a 60 second interval.
2. The LEDs represent 6 bits which can be used to count from 0 to 59. An LED that is turned on is meant to represent 1 and if it's turned off, it represents 0.
3. To modify the code to use different pins, we just need to change the pins physically and change the code itself so that the pins set up in it are the same pins you change the wires to.
